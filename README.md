# Heston-Model-Calibration

The Heston model is a stochastic model developed to price options while accounting for variations in the asset price and volatility.
It assumes that the volatility of an asset follows a random process rather than a constant one.
I compared Heston model and Black-Sholes model, then calibrated Heston model with Python.
